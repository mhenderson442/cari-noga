    <h2>Bio</h2>

    <p>I write resilience stories about contemporary, unconventional families. My second novel, <a title="The Orphan Daughter" href="https://www.amazon.com/Orphan-Daughter-Cari-Noga-ebook/dp/B076BQ14KW/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8">The Orphan Daughter</a>, explores whether prickly Jane McArdle will do better at motherhood her second time around, after her orphaned niece Lucy Ortiz moves from New York City to Jane&#8217;s Michigan farm. It&#8217;s set in my hometown of Traverse City, Michigan, which made it a lot of fun to write.</p>
    <p>Resilience in a theme in my author journey as well. After failing to finish two different novels, I finally completed my debut, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sparrow-Migrations-Cari-Noga-ebook/dp/B00RYBZRLK/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1515248815&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=sparrow+migrations">Sparrow Migrations</a>,  during <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/">National Novel Writing Month</a> (NaNoWriMo) in 2010. It becames a semi-finalist in the 2011 Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award contest, with Publishers Weekly describing the manuscript as “brimming with humanity and grace.” Sparrow’s protagonist, Robby Palmer, a 12-year-old boy with autism, and his parents, Sam and Linda, embody many experiences my husband and I have had as parents to a son with autism. I self-published it in 2013 and 18 months later was lucky enough to receive an acquisition offer from Lake Union Publishing. an imprint of Amazon Publishing, which specializes in <a href="http://booksbywomen.org/qa-with-danielle-marshall-editorial-director-of-lake-union-publishing-an-imprint-of-amazon-publishing-by-mm-finck/">book club fiction</a>. <em>Sparrow</em> was re-released in paperback, digital, and audio formats in June 2015. It was nominated for the Great Michigan Read, a statewide reading project, in 2015-16. A five-part small-screen miniseries adaptation is now available &#8211; producers wanted!</p>
    <p>Like <em>Sparrow</em>, the first draft of <em>The Orphan Daughter</em> was written during NaNoWriMo (2013) &#8212; and refined over three more years of revision. It, too, focuses on relationships &#8211; how they can be messy and  uncomfortable but ultimately vital to our human nature. If you&#8217;re in a book club, I&#8217;d be honored to have you read it, and join the discussion in person if possible, or via Skype. Check out pictures of past clubs and discussion questions <a href="http://www.carinoga.com/?page_id=1329">here</a>.</p>
    <p>For both books I relied on skills and habits I cultivated during ten years as a newspaper reporter&#8211; being curious, tapping authoritative sources for research, observing people closely and setting deadlines. I also have a day job in public relations and two elementary school-age kids. A busy schedule forces me to be efficient with my writing time.</p>
